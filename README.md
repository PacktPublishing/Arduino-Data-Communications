**Learn how to configure databases, MQTT, REST APIs, and store data over LoRaWAN, HC-12, and GSM**

## What is this book about?
Arduino Data Communication focuses on IoTâ€™s Internet aspect, guiding you in setting up your own infrastructure for storing and managing the data collected from sensors. This book goes beyond microcontroller basics, equipping you with the knowledge essential for building real-world projects.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Explore data storage formats for both local and remote storage solutions
* Build projects that leverage the variety of communication standards
* Set up a database to host data transmitted from various projects
* Use MQTT and RESTful APIs to send data from devices to remote systems
* Prepare for multiple devices using high availability measures
* Use LoRa by implementing a gateway and a client
* Transmit temperature and humidity data over RS-485 and HC-12

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example,

The code will look like the following:
```
html, body, #map {
  height: 100%;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0
}
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for embedded systems engineers and electronics engineers who want to build IoT devices and gain insights into storing data collected from these devices, as well as establish communication between devices. The skills you learn in this book will come in handy even if your final product isn't built on Arduino. While prior experience with computers is assumed, expertise with embedded systems such as Arduino is not a prerequisite. Familiarity with Arduino programming will be beneficial, but not necessary.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-14).
### Software and Hardware List
